# Usefull-basic-scripts-for-CryoET-processing

As part of my PhD the idea was to publish a list of basic usefull scripts for cryoET data processing.

The scripts are mainly designed for using IMOD programs and AreTomo, but also MemBrain-seg and Cryo-CARE.

IMOD: https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/

AreTomo2: 

memBrain-seg: 

CryoCARE:
