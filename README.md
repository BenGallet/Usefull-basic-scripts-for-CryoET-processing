# Usefull-basic-scripts-for-CryoET-processing

As part of my PhD work, the idea was to make available a list of basic usefull scripts for cryoET data processing.

The scripts are mainly designed for using IMOD programs and AreTomo, but also MemBrain-seg and Cryo-CARE.

IMOD: https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/

AreTomo2: https://github.com/czimaginginstitute/AreTomo2

memBrain-seg: https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg?tab=readme-ov-file

CryoCARE: https://github.com/juglab/cryoCARE_pip

Scipion-em: https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/release-3.0.0/index.html
